# How to submit to Brainhack Proceedings

## Submission guidelines for authors.

To create a paper for your project, simply follow the instructions in the [Brainhack Proceedings template](https://github.com/brainhack-proceedings/template). It will take you through all the steps up to the submission based on a rich template that you can easily adapt to the needs of your paper.
Once your paper is ready, you can submit it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/brainhack-proceedings/submit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=HOPE+Object+Submission&template=hope-object-issue-template.md&title=) in this repository, using the "Submission" template, and fill in all the information.
 - Our team will fork your repository on `https://github.com/brainhack-proceedings/your_paper_id`.
 - We will configure a new github page, and make the paper information and pdf available on `https://brainhack-proceedings.github.io/your_paper_id`. The page will be refreshed every time a new version of the paper is released (revision1, revision2, etc).
 - A review issue will be opened on the fork, inviting some reviewers.
 - Reviewers will create issues. You will need to submit pull requests to address these issues. The editor will close each issue after reviewing they have been properly addressed.
 - After all issues have been addressed, a "publish" release will be made by the editor.
 - All versions of the paper will be posted on [https://brainhack-proceedings.github.io](https://brainhack-proceedings.github.io) right after the initial submission.
