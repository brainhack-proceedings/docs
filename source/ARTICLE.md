# Paper Guidelines
Here are guidelines to help you format your paper in an effective way. Some items are mandatory, while others are suggestions to help with the clarity and accessibility of the text. We recommend proceedings to **remain under four pages**, and shorter submissions are welcome. Exceptions can be granted by the editors if necessary (project with large scope running over multiple hackathons, for example).
